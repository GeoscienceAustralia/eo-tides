# Summary
A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

Spatiotemporal Earth observation data is usually considered in terms of date and time, and geographical space. In coastal Earth obseration data, the influence and location of the tide adds a further dimension that can be accounted for through the application of tide modelling. `eo-tides` provides a suite of powerful parallelized tools that enable the integration of satellite Earth observation data with tide modelling. Leveraging advanced global tide modelling functionality from the [`pyTMD`](https://pytmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, `eo-tides` combines [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), [`xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) and [`odc-geo`](https://odc-geo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) into a suite of tools that can be applied to petabytes of coastal satellite data, supporting coastal and ocean earth observation analysis for any time period or location globally. `eo-tides` supports a wide variety of global ocean models and includes functionality to model tide heights and phases (e.g. high, low, ebb, flow tides) in parallel, "tag" satellite data with tide heights corresponding to exact moments of image acquisition, integrate pixel based tide modelling through time, calculate statistics describing local tide dynamics and biases caused by interactions between tidal processes and satellite orbits and validate modelled tides using measured sea levels from coastal tide gauges (e.g. [GESLA Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis](https://gesla.org/)).

# Statement of need
Satellite Earth observation offers an unparalleled method to view and examine dynamic coastal environments over large temporal and spatial scales. The variable influence of tide in these regions provides an added dimension that influences the utility of coastal Earth obseration data. Numerous global tide models exist that can be used to estimate tide height for any given location, date and time and the [`pyTMD`](https://pytmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package is a python-based prediction software that enables tidal estimation from a variety of these models. `eo-tides` combines advanced tide modelling functionality from [`pyTMD`](https://pytmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), [`xarray`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) and [`odc-geo`](https://odc-geo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), enabling pixel based tide height attribution to Earth obseravtion data. Tide-height attributed Earth observation data has been used to map the mean annual position of the [coastline](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112734), generate [digital elevation models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.03.006) of the intertidal zone and create synthetic imagery composites of the coastal zone at [low and high tide](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10030480). `eo-tides` provides a suite of flexible, parallelized tools for efficient analysis of coastal and ocean Earth observation data â€“ from regional to continental and the global scale.
