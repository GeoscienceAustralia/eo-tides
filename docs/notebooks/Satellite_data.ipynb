    "# Combining tides with satellite data\n",
    "\n",
    "**This guide demonstrates how to combine tide modelling with satellite Earth observation (EO) data using the [`tag_tides`](../../api/#eo_tides.eo.tag_tides) and [`pixel_tides`](../../api/#eo_tides.eo.pixel_tides) functions from [`eo_tides.eo`](../../api/#eo_tides.eo).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these functions allow you to model the height of the tide at the exact moment of satellite image acquisition. \n",
    "This can then allow you to analyse satellite EO data by tidal conditions - for example, filter your data to satellite imagery collected during specific tidal stages (e.g. low or high tide).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both functions perform a similar function, they differ in complexity and performance. `tag_tides` assigns a single tide height to each timestep/satellite image, which is fast and efficient, and suitable for small-scale applications where tides are unlikely to vary across your study area. In constrast, `pixel_tide` models tides both through time *and* spatially, returning a tide height for every satellite pixel. This can be critical for producing seamless coastal EO datasets at large scale - however comes at the cost of performance.\n",
