    "# Calculating tide statistics and satellite biases\n",
    "\n",
    "**This guide demonstrates how to use the [`tide_stats`](../../api/#eo_tides.stats.tide_stats) and  [`pixel_stats`](../../api/#eo_tides.stats.pixel_stats) functions from [`eo_tides.stats`](../../api/#eo_tides.stats) to calculate local tide statistics and identify biases caused by interactions between tidal processes and satellite orbits.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex interactions between temporal tide dynamics and the regular mid-morning overpass timing of sun-synchronous sensors like Landsat or Sentinel-2 mean that satellites often does not observe the entire tidal cycle. \n",
    "Biases in satellite coverage of the tidal cycle can mean that tidal extremes (e.g. the lowest or highest tides at a location) may either never be captured by satellites, or be over-represented in the satellite EO record. \n",
    "Local tide dynamics can cause these biases to vary greatly both through time and spatially (Figure 1), making it challenging to consistently analyse and compare coastal processes consistently - particularly for large-scale (e.g. regional or global) analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that coastal EO analyses are not inadvertently affected by tide biases, it is important to compare how well the tides observed by satellites match the full range of tides at a location.\n",
    "The `tidal_stats` and `pixel_stats` functions compares the subset of tides observed by satellite data against the full range of tides modelled at a regular interval through time (every two hours by default) across the entire time period covered by the satellite dataset.\n",
    "This comparison is used to calculate several useful statistics and plots that summarise how well your satellite data capture real-world tidal conditions.\n",
    "\n",
