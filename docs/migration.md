# Migrating from `dea_tools`

The `eo-tides` package contains functions that were previously available in the [`Digital Earth Australia Notebooks and Tools` repository](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/).
To migrate your code from DEA Tools to `eo-tides`, please be aware of the following breaking changes:

## Breaking changes

### `model_tides` tide height column renamed

The output tide heights column generated by the `model_tides` function (when running in the default `output_format="long"` format) has been renamed from `tide_m` to `tide_height`.
This more clearly describes the data, particularly when used in combination with `output_units="cm"` or `output_units="mm"` which returns tide heights in non-metre units.

### Tide model directory environment variable updated

The `DEA_TOOLS_TIDE_MODELS` environmental variable has been renamed to `EO_TIDES_TIDE_MODELS`.
